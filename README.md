# Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical problem in many industries where retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
This project uses a **Deep Learning model** to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical customer data.

The workflow includes extensive data preprocessing, model training using neural networks, and performance evaluation using multiple classification metrics.

## 🧠 Model Description
- **Type:** Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **Hidden Layer Activation:** Sigmoid
- **Output Layer Activation:** Sigmoid
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Optimizer:** Adam
